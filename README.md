# ArduinoCandyCroc


This is the code for an Arduino crocodile project that will shut it's mouth using fishing wire 
pulled by a servo that is connected to an ultrasonic motion sensor

Based off a tutorial found @ https://www.instructables.com/Crocodile-That-Opens-and-Close-Its-Mouth-for-Hallo/
The tutorial can help with the cardboard construction, but it does not have working code.
