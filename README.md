# ArduinoCandyCroc


This is the code for an Arduino crocodile project that will shut its mouth using fishing wire 
pulled by a servo that is connected to an ultrasonic motion sensor

Based on a tutorial found @ https://www.instructables.com/Crocodile-That-Opens-and-Close-Its-Mouth-for-Hallo/
The tutorial can help with the cardboard construction but needs working code.
